# **YOLOv9 Face Mask Classification**
This repository implements face mask classification using the powerful YOLOv9 object detection model on the Kaggle "Face Mask Detection" dataset by andrewmvd [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection)).

## Project Goals
Train a YOLOv9 model to effectively classify faces with and without masks in images.
Provide clear instructions for replicating the training process and utilizing the trained model for mask classification tasks.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository:
``git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/yolov9-face-mask-classification.git``
Install dependencies:

Refer to the requirements.txt file and use a package manager like pip to install the necessary libraries.

## Download the dataset:

Download the "Face Mask Detection" dataset from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection)) and place it in the designated directory within the project structure.

## Training and Usage
Train the YOLOv9 model:

A script for training the model is provided (train.py). You can customize hyperparameters and training configurations within this script.

Run inference (classification):

Once the model is trained, a separate script (inference.py) demonstrates how to use the trained model to classify masks in new images.
